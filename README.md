Pandora is the new Virtual Learning Environment for the 21st century. It aims to deliver a seamless, compatible user experience across all devices and platforms. We believe in building up, starting with a simple working environment, and since Pandora uses new server-side scripting techniques to lessen the load and requirements on client devices - true *cloud* computing.

### Pandora replaces

For far too long, education has been promised cloud computing, and not reaped any of the benefits. Overpriced services such as Fronter dominate the market while not doing anything to deserve it. Pandora is completely free, and that for a start give us an advantage. The aforementioned Fronter also uses obsolete metaphors such as rooms, giving no real perspective of what is actually happening.

### Interconnectivity

Pandora will be able to transfer students' data to other Pandora networks with the ability to take out student data, if a student switches school, for example. This allows us to compete against larger VLEs.

### Easy installation

Installing Pandora will be a breeze - just run the downloaded .exe (link required) and the program will install itself to the required directory. These .exe will work as a GUI and within a terminal, for those using a terminal based server.

### Progressive enhancement
As mentioned earlier, rather than the likes of many VLEs where the installation of a program is assumed (i.e. Java, Adobe Flash, JavaScript) we use the technique of progressive enhancement. We first assume that the client (i.e. Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, etc) has no support for any of these, and we send to the client a copy of a website fit for a JavaScript-less environment. After the page is loaded onto the client, if JavaScript is enabled scripts are run to enhance the website experience through the use of animations and transitions to load new content rather than an entire page load, etc.
