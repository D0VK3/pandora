grunt-webify
============

Install:
```bash
npm install grunt-webify --save-dev
```

### What it does
Injects CSS, Javascript, EMCAScript6, SCSS, and CommonJS dependencies into HTML, EJS & DUST files.

Given an ejs (embedded javascript) file for example:
```html
<html>
   <head>
     <title>Index Page</title>
     <style  src="index.scss"></style>
     <script src="index.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1><%= title %></h1>
     <p>sdfsdfds</p>
   </body>
 </html>
```

SCSS files are compiled into to CSS files and javascript files are browserified (using another project called `browserify`) to get compiled versions with commonjs dependencies injected before being injected into the a completed file.

### Options

#### `jst`
Compiles HTML & EJS files into a template function.

#### `esnext`
This causes all EMCAScript 6 syntax to be automatically transpiled down to EMCAScript 5. This also affects the module system as it lets you do:

`import $ from "jquery"` which is equivalent to `var $ = require("jquery")`
`import { model } from "mongoose"` which is equivalent to `var model = require("mongoose").model;`
`import { model, Model } from "mongoose"` which is equivalent to `var model = require("mongoose").model, Model = require("mongoose").Model;`

#### `banner`
Adds a banner to the top of every file
